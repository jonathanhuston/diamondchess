<p>Welcome to Diamond Chess!</p>
<p>Diamond Chess is a simple chess program with a no-nonsense interface and homemade pieces.</p>
<p>Use it to play a quick game against the computer or another human without a lot of fuss or overhead.</p>
<p>Written in Swift by Jonathan Huston, pieces designed by Ella Huston.</p>
<p><img src="https://diamondchess.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/Board1-iPad.PNG" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p>
<p>Choose whether to play white against the computer, black against the computer, or against another human. </p>
<p>Flip the board if it&#39;s upside down from your perspective. </p>
<p>The computer&#39;s playing strengths are Terrible, Novice, and Decent.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re promoting a pawn, you have a few seconds to click through the possible pieces (queen, knight, rook, bishop).</p>
<p>That&#39;s it! Have fun!</p>
