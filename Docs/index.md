##Diamond Chess

Welcome to Diamond Chess!

Diamond Chess is a simple chess program with a no-nonsense interface and homemade pieces.

Use it if you want to play a quick game against the computer or another human without a lot of fuss or overhead.

Written in Swift by Jonathan Huston, pieces designed by Ella Huston.

Choose whether to play white against the computer, black against the computer, or against another human. 

Flip the board if it's upside down from your perspective. 

The computer's playing strength can be Terrible, Novice, Decent, or Creative.

If you're promoting a pawn, you have a few seconds to click through the possible pieces (queen, knight, rook, bishop).

That's it! Have fun!
